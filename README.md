# <Prework study guide>

## Description

This study guide was created to help beginning web development students get a rudimentary understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and git. The creation of this project was a lesson in itself, but more importantly, it can be used as a reference for the fundamentals of coding. It describes the basic functions of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and git, as well as their more important characteristics. Creating this taught me the basic syntax of these tools, as well as their uses.
